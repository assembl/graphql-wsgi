# wsgi_graphql

Port of [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql)
to Python and WSGI. Uses [graphqllib](https://github.com/dittos/graphqllib).

For a demo of how this can be used to create a GraphQL server (with Relay
support) in Python, see [relaypy](https://github.com/faassen/relaypy).
